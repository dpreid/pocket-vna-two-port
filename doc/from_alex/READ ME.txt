Hey Tim, hope your good.

"Copper Mountain VNA" folder contains successfull measurements using a commercial VNA calibrated using the built in standards of the system.

"PocketVNA" folder contains successful measurements using the PocketVNA calibrated using the built in standards of the system.

These two should be all the data you need.

In addition to this i have also supplied a brief PT and MALAB code (almost certain you wont need but there if you want to see anything)

Lastly you will also notice that in this folder there are 4 touchstone files (DUT_1_REF TO DUT_4_REF) these are the "ideal" S-parameters of each
DUT found by connecting a commercial VNA directly across each DUT. Thought these might help establish how far off both the commercial VNA and Pocket VNA are 
from the "ideal"

Anyway hope that not too much extra waffle etc. Any issues just drop me an email.

Thanks,
Alex
